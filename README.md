## Welcome to the world of Eberon

[![World map screen](https://github.com/Aroueterra/RPG_Framework/blob/master/graphics/Main.PNG)]()

The world of Eberon is... a work in progress!
In the world of Eberon, you play the role of a miscreant adventurer as he works his way up through skill and valor to become a mighty hero. Entering a lawless land outside the city walls, you must fight to survive.

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="https://github.com/Aroueterra/RPG_Framework/blob/master/graphics/if_Knight_2913116.png">

```sh
You are negotiating passage to the northern mountains with the gatekeeper of New Estera when suddenly, the southern gates burst wide open.
 A calvacade of armed men, likely the king's own guard, marches through and into the heart of the city.
 Everyone stares in awe, but you decide to take this opportunity to slip past.
        Make your choice.
```
